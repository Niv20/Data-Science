    "Programmers often ask, \"If an integer is **immutable**, how can I successfully run `x = 1` and then `x = x + 1`?\" This works because you are not changing the original object; you are changing which object the variable x references.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what actually happens in memory. When you run `x = 1`, Python creates an integer object with the value 1 and makes the variable x point to it. When you then execute `x = x + 1`, Python first evaluates the expression, which results in a new integer object, then creates this new object in memory and re-assigns the variable x to point to it, breaking the old reference to 1.\n",

In languages like C and C++, when you have memory that is no longer needed, you must manually `free` it yourself. Python, however, does this work for you automatically. It has a built-in \"garbage collector\" that finds any objects with no references pointing to them and deletes them.\n",

    "### 1.5 Basic Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three important things to notice about operators in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A. Operations on different types:** In Python, the same operator can behave differently depending on the data type of the values it is used with. For example, the `+` operator will perform arithmetic addition when used with two numbers. However, when that same operator is used with two strings or lists, it performs concatenation (joining them) to be one combined string or list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "10 + 7              # 17\n",

    "[1, 2] + [3, 4]     # [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Division in Python:** In contrast to C or C++, here, the standard division operator `/` always returns a decimal number. This is true even if the result is a whole number, which will be shown with a `.0` at the end. If you need integer division that drops any remainder - you must use the `//` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "4 / 2    # 2.0 (a float)\n",
    "5 / 2    # 2.5 (a float)\n",
    "5 // 2   # 2 (an integer)\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Readable logical operators:** Python's logical operators are very readable. Instead of using `&&`, `||` and `!`, you simply write the words `and`, `or` and `not`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "(12 > 10) and (19 > 98)   # False\n",

    "### 7.1 Opening and Closing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To work with a file, you must first create a link between a variable in your program and the file itself. This action of creating the link is called \"opening\" a file. Once the file is open, you can perform operations on the file variable to read from or write to the file on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, this is a manual three-step process: you open the file, you work with it, and then you must explicitly command the file to close. This traditional method, which also works in Python, looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The \"old\" manual way\n",
    "my_file = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "# Do something with the file...\n",
    "my_file.close() # You must remember to close it\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python provides a much safer and more convenient way to manage files using the `with` statement. This syntax creates a block, and Python **automatically** closes the file for you when the code exits that block, even if an error occurs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The \"new\" automatic way\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"w\") as my_file:\n",
    "    # Do something with the file...\n",
    "# The file is now automatically closed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `open()` function takes two main arguments. The first is the filename (e.g., `\"data.txt\"`) and the second is the **mode**, which is a string that tells the operating system what you want to do. The two most basic modes are `\"w\"` for **write** (to save new data) and `\"r\"` for **read** (to get existing data).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file with `\"r\"`:\n",
    "- if the file **doesn't** exist - you will get an error.\n",
    "- if the file exists - you can read its content (but not modify it, of course).\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a file with `\"w\"`:\n",
    "-  if the file **doesn't** exist yet - this mode will create a new, empty file for you. \n",
    "-  if the file already exists - this mode will immediately **overwrite and erase** all existing content in that file, and start fresh with an empty file."

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"w\") as my_file:\n",
    "    my_file.write(\"Hello, world\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When a file is open, you can think of it as having a cursor or \"handle\" that marks your current position. When you open a file in `'w'` (write) mode, this handle is placed at the very beginning of the file. After you call `.write()` to add text, the handle moves to the end of that new text. This ensures that the next `write()` call will add its data **after** the previous data, rather than overwriting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some way, `.write()` and `print()` are similar. Just as `print()` writes things to the console, `.write()` writes things into your file. However, there are two critical differences between `write()` and `print()` that you must remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `write()` method accepts **only one string argument**. It does not perform any automatic type conversion. If you try to pass a number, list, or any other data type, your program will raise a `TypeError`. You must manually convert all non-string data using `str()` before writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `.write()` **doesn't** add an automatic newline at the end. Unlike `print()`, you must explicitly include the `\\n` character in the string yourself if you want the text to start on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"info.txt\", \"w\") as my_file:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**A. Read the Entire File**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest method is `.read()`. This reads the **entire file** from the cursor's current position and returns its content as a **single string**. If the file contains multiple lines, they will all be in this one string, separated by the `\\n` newline character. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**B. Read All Lines into a List**\n",
    "\n",
    "A second method is `.readlines()`, which also reads the entire file at once. However, instead of returning one string, it returns a **list**, where each item in the list is a string representing one line from the file (including its `\\n` newline character).\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of this method is that once you have the list, you can access any line directly by its index.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as my_file:\n",
    "    all_lines = my_file.readlines()\n",
    "    # 'all_lines' is a list, e.g., [\"Line 1\\n\", \"Line 2\\n\", \"Line 3\\n\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "    second_line = all_lines[1]  # \"Line 2\\n\"\n",
    "    last_line = all_lines[-1]   # \"Line 3\\n\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**C. Read One Line at a Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of reading all lines at once, you can use `.readline()` to read just **one line** from the file, starting from the cursor's current position. After the line is read, the cursor moves to the start of the **next** line. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is much more efficient for large files, but it has a trade-off. Now, you can't jump to a specific line. To read the last line, you would first have to read (and discard) the first, second, third lines, and so on, until you get to the last line...\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as my_file:\n",
    "    first_line = my_file.readline()  # Reads line 1\n",
    "    second_line = my_file.readline() # Reads line 2\n",
    "    # The cursor is now at the start of line 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**D. The `for` Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "the most common way to process a file is to loop over the file object directly. Python will automatically get one line at a time, just like `.readline()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(\"data.txt\", \"r\") as my_file:\n",
    "\n",
    "    for line in my_file:\n",
    "        # 'line' will be \"Line 1\\n\", then \"Line 2\\n\", etc.\n",
    "        # You can do something with the line here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Warning: The Cursor Only Moves Forward: Remember that the file cursor only moves in one direction. Once a method like `.read()` or `.readlines()` has read the *entire* file, the cursor is at the end. If you try to read from the file again, it will return an empty string (`\"\"`) or an empty list (`[]`) because there is nothing left to read."
